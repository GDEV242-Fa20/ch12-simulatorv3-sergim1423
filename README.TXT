Created a bear subclass of Animal. My bear sleeps a lot but when hes hungry he goes out looking for 
dead foxes, either he can kill them or any dead fox carcus will do, in this Bear class, they reproduce at high numbers but 
the chance of them to populate at the high rate is low. I used the fox class as an outline of how the code should look and how it needs to be executed
the major changes i made is made the bear have a longer life expectancy and doesnt have any predetors that exist in this simulation. With not to much changing with the code my assumption is that it will work in a way that bears will control the wild. They will be the dominate predetor because of their life expectancy and high litter size. 

A predator-prey simulation involving foxes and rabbits in
an enclosed rectangular field.

This is the first version of the simulation. This version
does not use inheritance.

How to start:
    Create a Simulator object.
    Then call one of:
        + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
        + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
        + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
